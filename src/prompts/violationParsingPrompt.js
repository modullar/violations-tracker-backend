## Requirements and guidelines

1. Violation type: Categorize the violation using one of the predefined types: AIRSTRIKE, CHEMICAL_ATTACK, DETENTION, DISPLACEMENT, EXECUTION, SHELLING, SIEGE, TORTURE, MURDER, SHOOTING, HOME_INVASION, EXPLOSION, AMBUSH, KIDNAPPING, OTHER

2. Dates: Extract the date of the violation in YYYY-MM-DD format. If only month/year is available, use the first day of the month. For dates mentioned in Arabic, convert to the Gregorian calendar.

3. Location: Include both the specific location name and broader administrative division (governorate/province). Provide both English and Arabic versions.

4. Description: Summarize the key details of the violation, including what happened, to whom, and by whom. Keep the description factual and comprehensive. Provide in both English and Arabic.

5. Perpetrator: Identify the group(s) or entity responsible for the violation. Map to one of the predefined affiliations: assad_regime, post_8th_december_government, various_armed_groups, isis, sdf, israel, turkey, druze_militias, russia, iran_shia_militias, unknown

6. Victims: Extract details about victims when available. If multiple victims are mentioned but details are only provided collectively, create a single entry with the collective information.

7. Certainty level: Assess the certainty of the report as:
   - confirmed: Multiple credible sources or official documentation
   - probable: Single credible source with specific details
   - possible: Unconfirmed reports or limited information

8. If the report contains multiple distinct violations, create separate entries for each if they can be clearly distinguished with different dates, locations, or types.

9. If the exact date is unclear, make a reasonable estimate based on context and note this in the description.

10. If some information is missing, populate fields with appropriate default values rather than leaving them out.

11. For any text that needs to be translated between English and Arabic, ensure accurate translation while maintaining the original meaning.
