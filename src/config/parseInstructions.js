## IMPORTANT CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. **Time-Based Classification**: For incidents before December 8, 2024, classify all government forces as "assad_regime". For incidents after this date, use "assad_regime" only for forces explicitly identified as Assad loyalists or remnants.

2. **Default Classification**: If a perpetrator is mentioned but affiliation is unclear, use "unknown" rather than making assumptions.

3. **Multiple Affiliations**: If multiple perpetrators with different affiliations are involved, list the primary perpetrator and their affiliation.

4. **Changing Affiliations**: Some groups have changed affiliations over time. Use the affiliation that was accurate at the time of the incident.

5. **Generalized References**: For general references to "regime forces" or "government forces" before December 8, 2024, use "assad_regime". For references to "opposition" or "rebels" before this date, use "post_8th_december_government".

6. **Iranian Proxies Recognition**: For any Shiite militias or groups described as "Iranian-backed" operating in Syria, classify as "iran_shia_militias" unless they are more specifically affiliated with another category.

7. **New or Unrecognized Groups**: If a group is not listed here, attempt to determine its broader affiliation based on the context of the report, or use "various_armed_groups" if unable to determine a clear affiliation.

# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS fill administrative_division.en with the appropriate administrative division (e.g., "Damascus Governorate", "Aleppo Governorate", "Homs Governorate", "Latakia Governorate", "Hama Governorate", "Idlib Governorate", "Deir ez-Zor Governorate", "Al-Hasakah Governorate", "Al-Raqqah Governorate", "Daraa Governorate", "Quneitra Governorate", "Tartus Governorate", "Al-Suwayda Governorate")
- If location is a city, use the governorate name for administrative_division.en
- If location is a governorate, use the same name for administrative_division.en
- NEVER leave administrative_division.en empty - this will cause validation failure
- DETENTION violations require detained_count > 0
- KIDNAPPING violations require kidnapped_count > 0  
- DISPLACEMENT violations require displaced_count > 0
- For Assad regime incidents before Dec 8, 2024: use "assad_regime"

- Default perpetrator_affiliation: "unknown" if unclear

# IMPORTANT PROCESSING RULES

1. Do not invent information not present in the report
2. When information is ambiguous, use the more conservative interpretation

4. For violations with multiple locations or dates, create separate violation objects
5. Use full sentences for descriptions, not bullet points
6. Do not include coordinates unless explicitly provided in the report
7. Flag any potentially duplicate violations based on date, location, and type matching
