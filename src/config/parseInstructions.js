2. **Default Classification**: If a perpetrator is mentioned but affiliation is unclear, use "unknown" rather than making assumptions.

3. **Multiple Affiliations**: If multiple perpetrators with different affiliations are involved, list the primary perpetrator and their affiliation.

4. **Changing Affiliations**: Some groups have changed affiliations over time. Use the affiliation that was accurate at the time of the incident.

5. **Generalized References**: For general references to "regime forces" or "government forces" before December 8, 2024, use "assad_regime". For references to "opposition" or "rebels" before this date, use "post_8th_december_government".

6. **Iranian Proxies Recognition**: For any Shiite militias or groups described as "Iranian-backed" operating in Syria, classify as "iran" unless they are more specifically affiliated with another category.

7. **New or Unrecognized Groups**: If a group is not listed here, attempt to determine its broader affiliation based on the context of the report, or use "various_armed_groups" if unable to determine a clear affiliation.
